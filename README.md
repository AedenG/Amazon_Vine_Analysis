## Results

### Total Reviews by type
- There are 497 total paid Amazon Vine reviews
- There are 120,863 total unpaid reviews

### 5-Star Reviews
- There are 220 5-star rated Amazon Vine reviews
- 74,470 5-star reviews were unpaid reviews

### Percentage of 5-star Reviews
- 44.27% of paid reviews were 5-star reviews
- 61.62% of unpaid reviews were 5-star reviews

## Summary 
There is no positivity bias in the Health and Personal Care dataset by Amazon Vine program paid members. The 44.27% and 61.62% of paid members versus unpaid reviewers respectively support this conclusion. Furthermore, an additional analysis was performed that showed 29.58% of paid members versus 27.61% of unpaid reviewers gave reviews that scored less than or equal to 3 stars. This supports the original conclusion that there is no positively bias in the dataset.
